# Technical Analysis Report for FIG Stock

## Executive Summary

FIG stock has experienced a dramatic and sustained downtrend over the analyzed period, with the price declining from approximately $115.50 on July 31st to $53.07 on September 12th - a staggering 54% decline in just over six weeks. The technical indicators paint a picture of severe bearish momentum with some potential oversold conditions emerging.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Trend Analysis
The moving averages reveal a clear and powerful bearish trend structure:
- **200 SMA**: Declining from 87.35 to 73.87, indicating long-term bearish momentum
- **50 SMA**: Mirroring the 200 SMA decline from 87.35 to 73.87, confirming medium-term weakness
- **10 EMA**: Showing the most dramatic decline from 81.64 to 57.78, reflecting intense short-term selling pressure

The significant gap between the current price (~$53) and all moving averages (10 EMA at 57.78, 50/200 SMA at 73.87) indicates the stock is trading well below all major trend indicators, confirming the severe bearish environment.

### Momentum Indicators
**MACD Analysis**: The MACD has been consistently negative throughout the period, ranging from -2.37 to -6.07. The deepening negative values (-6.07 on September 12th) suggest accelerating bearish momentum with no signs of reversal. The consistent negative readings indicate sustained selling pressure.

**RSI Analysis**: The RSI shows the stock has been in oversold territory (<30) for most of the period, with readings as low as 25.94. While traditionally this would suggest a potential reversal, the persistent oversold conditions in a strong downtrend indicate continued weakness rather than immediate reversal potential.

### Volatility and Support/Resistance
**Bollinger Bands**: The bands have contracted significantly from their wide formation in mid-August (Upper: 116.80, Lower: 57.89) to much tighter levels in September (Upper: 84.53, Lower: 46.47). This contraction suggests decreasing volatility, which often precedes significant price moves. The current price near the lower band indicates oversold conditions.

**ATR Analysis**: The Average True Range has declined from 12.38 to 6.15, indicating substantially reduced volatility. This 50% reduction in volatility suggests the selling pressure may be exhausting, but the low ATR also means any new trend could develop with less dramatic moves.

### Critical Observations

1. **Price Action**: The stock experienced an initial sharp decline from $115 to $78 in early August, followed by a consolidation phase around $70-80, and then another severe breakdown to the $50-55 range in September.

2. **Volume Patterns**: The highest volume occurred during the initial decline (64M shares on July 31st) and the September breakdown (29M shares on September 4th), indicating institutional selling at key breakdown points.

3. **Support Levels**: The stock found temporary support around $70-75 in mid-August but failed to hold, suggesting weak buyer interest. The current level around $53 represents a critical test of investor confidence.

## Risk Assessment

The extremely oversold RSI readings combined with declining volatility (ATR) suggest the selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion. However, the persistent negative MACD and price trading well below all moving averages indicate the primary trend remains decisively bearish.

## Key Technical Levels

| Indicator | Current Value | Signal | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Price** | $53.07 | Bearish | Trading 28% below 10 EMA |
| **10 EMA** | 57.78 | Bearish | Declining sharply |
| **50/200 SMA** | 73.87 | Bearish | Well above current price |
| **MACD** | -6.07 | Bearish | Deeply negative, accelerating |
| **RSI** | 31.20 | Oversold | Near oversold threshold |
| **Bollinger Position** | Near Lower Band | Oversold | Potential support test |
| **ATR** | 6.15 | Low Volatility | 50% reduction from peak |
| **Trend** | Strong Downtrend | Bearish | All timeframes aligned bearish |

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: HOLD/AVOID** - While the stock appears oversold on some indicators, the overwhelming bearish momentum, price well below all moving averages, and negative MACD suggest continued weakness. The low ATR indicates reduced volatility but doesn't necessarily signal a reversal. Investors should wait for clear bullish confirmation signals before considering entry, such as a MACD crossover above zero or price reclaiming the 10 EMA.
