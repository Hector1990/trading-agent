After carefully reviewing the proposed investment plan and cross-referencing it with current market conditions, technical indicators, and fundamental strengths of FIG, I find the analysis to be well-reasoned and aligned with a disciplined, phased approach to capitalizing on oversold conditions in a high-quality asset.

The key takeaways reinforcing a buy recommendation are:
- Exceptional gross margins (88.3%) and strong balance sheet ($490M cash, minimal debt) indicate resilience and long-term value.
- Institutional accumulation (e.g., ARK) signals confidence among sophisticated investors.
- Macro tailwinds (potential rate cuts) may favor growth stocks like FIG in the medium term.
- The phased entry strategy mitigates risk from catching a "falling knife," incorporating technical confirmations (MACD/RSI stabilization, moving average reclaims) before scaling further.

This approach addresses past errors of premature entries by emphasizing patience and confirmation signals, while the hard stop-loss at $47 provides clear risk management.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
