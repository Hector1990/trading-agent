After reviewing the provided investment plan and rationale for Tesla (TSLA), I find the analysis to be well-reasoned and aligned with both momentum and fundamental catalysts. The emphasis on insider conviction, energy division growth, technical momentum, and a disciplined entry/exit strategy addresses key risks while positioning for upside. The plan effectively balances the bullish narrative with prudent risk management, incorporating lessons from past mistakes by avoiding emotional exits during overbought conditions and emphasizing systematic profit-taking.

Given the strong momentum indicators, CEO insider buying as a high-conviction signal, and the strategic scaling approach to limit downside, I support the recommendation to initiate a position in TSLA. The proposed entry around $368â€“$375 offers a favorable risk/reward setup, and the stop-loss at $331 provides clear downside protection.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
